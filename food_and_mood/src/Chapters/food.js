        Traditional diets (such as Mediterranean, Scandinavian, and Japanese) have been shown to help prevent depression. Researchers believe that this is because they rely on a wide variety of minimally-processed foods and fish.

        "Traditional diets" mean diets that existed before the modern American diet.
      </Typography>,
      <Typography>
        Alright, of course, everyone knows these things are healthy for you. The point here is to make sure that these make up <em>most</em> of your diet, which leads us to the third principle:
      </Typography>,
      <Typography className="winkAfter">
        I'm sure this isn't a big surprise either. A significant amount of fast food, commercially produced baked goods, white breads, and sweets in the diet all make depression more likely. All of these things tend to increase brain inflammation and reduce many types of brain function, both of which are associated with depression. (Of course, we wouldn't deny that some chocolate in moderation can be a powerful mood booster.) 
      </Typography>,
      <Typography>
        Funnily enough, there's a lot of evidence that including a lot of fish in your diet helps prevent depression. Scientists think it's because of certain omega-3 fatty acids in fish, which can help reduce inflammation in the brain and enhance certain brain functions that are reduced in depressed people.
